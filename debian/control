Description: multimedia framework from KDE - metapackage
 Phonon is the Qt 4 multimedia API, which provides a task-oriented abstraction
 layer for capturing, mixing, processing, and playing audio and video content.
 .
 This metapackage ensures that the system has a working Phonon configuration
 installed (the core library and at least one back-end).
