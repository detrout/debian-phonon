Description: metapackage for the Phonon multimedia framework
 Phonon is the Qt 4 multimedia API, which provides a task-oriented abstraction
 layer for capturing, mixing, processing, and playing audio and video content.
 .
 This metapackage ensures that a user has working Phonon configuration
 installed on the system (the core library and at least one backend).
